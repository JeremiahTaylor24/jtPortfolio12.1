# Jeremiah Taylor's Portfolio

## Description
This site will act as my practice field for my time in class. I will add my class projects as well as outside projects as I finish them. This will be the place for potential employers or clients to see my work. It is still in it's early stages but I plan to continue developing my skills and creating more content to add. 

## Installation

## Usage
I will be able to send links to this page to people anywhere to allow them to see my content. As more is added, it will become more benificial to my software development journey.
