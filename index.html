            <h2 class="subTitle">Welcome to my portfolio!!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jeremiah Taylor but my friend's call me JT. I've created this portfolio to act as a creative hub for all of my projects. I will be adding more as I progress through my coding bootcamp. I will also use this as a place to showcase other projects I am working on outside of class.</p>

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>It is hard to say exactly what I am. I have spent time in many different career fields over my 24 years. From working at a zoo to working as a deckhand on a small ship cruiseline, I've seen a lot. However, my journey in Software Development is my newest adventure. I plan to pursue this new opportunity to improve my life as well as others. I hope to continue to make connections with mentors and peers who can guide me along my path of education. I am excited to put my knowledge and experience to use in this industry and look forward to developing my developers' mindset. </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>As I continue my journey, I will be able to add more projects. For now, we have these three assignments from class. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>I.</span> We have a prework assignment created to help students study basic terms related to each language.</li>
            <li><span>II.</span> The first project I worked on to refractor code. After a couple of trys I started to see the changes I needed to make.</li>
            <li><span>III.</span> This is not a published webpage but I wanted to show the difference of where I was when I started to where I am now. Look at the difference!</li>
