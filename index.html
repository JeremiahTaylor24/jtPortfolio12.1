            <h2 class="subTitle">Welcome to my portfolio!!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jeremiah Taylor but my friend's call me JT. I've created this portfolio to act as a creative hub for all of my projects. I will be adding more as I progress through my coding bootcamp. I will also use this as a place to showcase other projects I am working on outside of class.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I never imagined I would end up in a career field like software development. Throughout high school and university, I thought I would be auditioning to perform on broadway. However, it has been an interesting journey finding my way here! </p>
